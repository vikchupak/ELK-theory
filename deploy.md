# Deploy plan

- Amazon OpenSearch Service + Logstash + Filebeat > deploy to AWS EKS.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create EKS cluster**

* Make sure **OIDC provider is enabled** for IRSA (needed for pods to authenticate to OpenSearch via IAM).
* Create **namespaces** for apps, logging, etc.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create OpenSearch domain (before shipping logs)**

* Better to create the **OpenSearch domain first**, so Logstash/Filebeat can be configured to send logs immediately.
* Configure **VPC access** if your EKS is private.
* Set **master user** (IAM role via IRSA or internal credentials).

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy your microservices app**

* Make sure pods are running and producing logs.
* Label pods/namespaces if you want selective logging.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Logstash**

* Configure it with **OpenSearch endpoint + credentials**.
* Optional: configure **filters, grok patterns, enrichments**.
* Expose a **beats input port** (5044) so Filebeat can send logs.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Filebeat (or Fluent Bit) as DaemonSet**

* Collect logs from all pods/nodes.
* Point **output to Logstash** (or directly to OpenSearch if you skip Logstash).
* Add **Kubernetes metadata** (pod name, namespace, labels).

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Verify logs flow**

* Make sure logs appear in OpenSearch.
* Test queries and dashboards in OpenSearch Dashboards.

---

## **Optional / recommended additions**

1. **IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA)**

   * Assign to Logstash/Filebeat pods if using IAM auth for OpenSearch.

2. **Kubernetes secrets**

   * If using internal username/password, store in secrets instead of plain text.

3. **Metrics collection**

   * Use Metricbeat or Prometheus exporters for pod/cluster metrics.

4. **Retention & index management**

   * Configure OpenSearch index rollover policies for log retention.

5. **Alerting & dashboards**

   * OpenSearch Dashboards allows alerts and visualizations.

---

‚úÖ **Corrected plan (recommended order)**

1. Create EKS cluster + enable OIDC for IRSA
2. Create OpenSearch domain + configure access
3. Deploy microservices app
4. Deploy Logstash (with pipeline config pointing to OpenSearch)
5. Deploy Filebeat DaemonSet pointing to Logstash
6. Verify logs, dashboards, metrics, retention

- AWS uses a term "domain" to point to "OpenSearch cluster". While OpenSearch itself uses the term cluster internally, AWS adds domain to emphasize:
  - Managed service boundary (you don‚Äôt manage individual nodes directly).
  - Billing and resource grouping.
  - Unique endpoint for API access (each domain gets its own URL).

# AWS-managed service
- **Amazon Elasticsearch Service.** Before **2021**. It ran the official `Elasticsearch 7.x and Kibana 7.x` from Elastic under the Apache 2.0 license.
- **Amazon OpenSearch Service.** After the license change in **2021** (Elastic switched to SSPL/Elastic License).
  - AWS could no longer offer the latest Elasticsearch/Kibana under Apache 2.0.
  - AWS forked Elasticsearch and Kibana 7.10 ‚Üí renamed the service to Amazon OpenSearch Service.
  - Kibana was forked ‚Üí OpenSearch Dashboards.
  - AWS continued maintaining backward-compatible API and features.

---

- Only Elasticsearch and Kibana were effected by the licence change. Logstash remains the same.
- **Latest Elasticsearch 8.x + Kibana 8.x ‚Üí require paid subscription.**

# OpenSearch

- OpenSearch is a community-driven, open-source search and analytics engine.
- It is a fork of Elasticsearch 7.10 after Elastic changed their license.
- **Maintained by Amazon Web Services and the OpenSearch community.**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open-source status

* **OpenSearch is fully open-source** under **Apache 2.0 license**.
* This means anyone can use, modify, fork, or redistribute it freely.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ AWS role

* **AWS initiated OpenSearch** in 2021 as a **fork of Elasticsearch 7.10 and Kibana 7.10**.
* Why: Elastic changed the license of Elasticsearch/Kibana to SSPL/Elastic License, making newer versions not fully open-source.
* AWS wanted a **continuation of the open-source project** that would remain free and compatible with existing Elasticsearch 7.10 clients and APIs.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Maintained by AWS

* **AWS leads the development and release process**, contributing major code, fixes, and new features.
* However, **OpenSearch is community-driven**, so anyone can contribute.
* It‚Äôs like: AWS is the **primary steward** and sponsor, but the project is open for the community.

---

üí° **Key takeaway:**

* **Yes, AWS started OpenSearch**, but it‚Äôs **fully open-source**.
* Other companies or contributors can also participate in development.
